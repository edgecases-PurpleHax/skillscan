## Overview

Google News adds current editorial coverage aggregated across many publishers through the public RSS search feed. It is useful when the query is about recent events, announcements, or developing stories and the search should stay broad across mainstream news outlets without depending on a private API key.

## Known Quirks

- RSS only provides headlines and short summaries, not full article bodies.
- The `link` field is a Google News redirect URL rather than the direct publisher URL, and v1 keeps it intentionally to avoid lossy or failure-prone decoding.
- The feed is hardcoded to `hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en` for v1; non-English and non-US market variants are a follow-up.

# Quality Bar

- Evidence items have non-empty title and url.
- No crash on empty or malformed API response.
- Source channel field matches the channel name.
